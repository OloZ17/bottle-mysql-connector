## Style Guide

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```
Add support for connection pooling

- Implement pool configuration in Plugin.__init__
- Add pool_size and pool_name parameters
- Update documentation with pooling examples

Fixes #123
```

### Documentation Style

- Use Markdown for documentation files
- Include code examples for new features
- Update README.md if adding new functionality
- Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on external services
- Use mocking for database connections in unit tests
- Name test files as `test_*.py`
- Name test functions as `test_*`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=bottle_mysql_connector

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_plugin.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_plugin.py::TestMySQLConnectorPlugin::test_plugin_initialization
```

## Release Process
